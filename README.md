## Description

Gig Tracker is a simple CRUD, MVC Sinatra app for users located in NYC that allows the user to add to a master list of gigs—including the Artists, Venue, Date and Time of event—where all users have the ability to view. A user can:

1. Sign up for a new account
2. Log in to said account
3. See an index of gigs added by all users
5. View a list of gigs added by the current user
7. Edit the gig's info only if the current user created it
8. Add new gigs to the index
9. Delete a gig only if they created it
